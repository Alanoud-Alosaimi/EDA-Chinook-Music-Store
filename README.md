# EDA-Chinook-Music-Store
The Chinook music store contains information about the artists, songs, and albums, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases. In this project, I will use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with the use of summary statistics and graphical representations, refers to the crucial process of completing early investigations on data in order to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions. I'll assist the Chinook team in understanding the media in their shop, their customers and employees, and their invoice information.
